# Linux-Commands

### What is this?
This is a Compendium of Linux Commands (descriptions & helpful personal examples) that I have documented while using them throughout personal projects, studies, and work. 

### Demo of Commands:

I have coded a simple webpage to display the commands. Each command has a title, description, and example.

You can find the site: 

### Purpose:

Creating a helpful and easy-to-follow reference of previously used Linux commands and displaying my progress with Linux.

### Main Branch:

This contains the folders and documents with Linux work.

### Hosted Site Branch:

This contains the code for the web page with the organized Linux commands, their description, and examples of how they were used.

### Will this Repo be Updated?

This won't happen too often since the Linux commands are used in the terminal and I'm not always actively documenting them unless it's a niche or new command I'm learning. However, when I notice a build-up of new documentation of Linux commands, I will update the folders here as well as the site eventually.
