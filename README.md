# My-Linux-Commands

### What is this?

This is a Compendium of Linux Commands (files with descriptions & helpful personal examples) that I have documented while using them throughout personal projects, studies, and work. 

I have also coded a simple webpage to display these commands in an organized manner. Each command has a title, description, and example.

### Purpose:

Creating a helpful and easy-to-follow personal reference of previously used Linux commands and displaying my progress with Linux.

### Demo of Linux Commands Site:



### Main Branch:

This contains the folders and documents with Linux work.

### Hosted Site Branch:

This contains the code for the web page with the organized Linux commands, their description, and examples of how they were used.

### Will this Repo be Updated?

This won't happen too often since the Linux commands are used in the terminal and I'm not always actively documenting them unless it's a niche or new command I'm learning. 

However, when I notice a build-up of new documentation of Linux commands, I will update the folders here as well as the site eventually.
