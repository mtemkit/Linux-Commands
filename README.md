# My-Linux-Commands

### What is this?

This is a Compendium of Linux Commands (files with descriptions & helpful personal examples) that I have documented while using them throughout personal projects, studies, and work. 

I have also coded a simple webpage to display these commands in an organized manner so that I can quickly find forgotten commands and review how I previously used them. Each command has a title, and description with an example.

### Purpose:

Creating a helpful and easy-to-follow personal reference of previously used Linux commands and displaying my progress with Linux. 

### Live Site Demo:

https://mtemkit.github.io/My-Linux-Commands (work in progress)

### Main Branch:

This contains the code for the web page with the organized Linux commands and their description with an example of how they've been used for personal reference.

### Linux Files and Folders Branch

This contains some of my documented folders and documents with Linux work.

### Will this Repo be Updated?

This won't happen too often since the Linux commands are used in the terminal and I'm not always actively documenting them unless ideally, it's a niche or new command I'm learning. 

However, when I notice a build-up of new documentation of Linux commands, I will update the linux files/folders branch here as well as the site eventually if I find that adding them in one place helps me to be more efficient.
